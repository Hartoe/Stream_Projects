# Twitch Bot

This program contains a basic layout for a twitch bot.
You do have to supply the bot with a _.env_ file that you have to
fill with the following variables:
 * __TMI_TOKEN__
   * This is where you'll put the oauth token of twitch
 * __CLIENT_ID__
   * This is where you'll put the client id of your twitch dev app
 * __BOT_NICK__
   * This is the name of the bot account
 * __BOT_PREFIX__
   * This is the prefix used for commands
 * __CHANNEL__
   * This is the name of the channel the bot should connect to
After filling out the _.env_ file you can run the code and add custom
commands.
