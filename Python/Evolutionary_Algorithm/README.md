# Evolutionary Algorithm

This script will generate a _n_-order function and the run an evolutionary algorithm to learn it.<br>
The program takes two parameters. The first is the order of the function, the second is the size of a generation.

    e.g. *py poly_learner.py 3 100*

This example will run the program with a generation size of 100 and a 3rd order function.
